"""
NBA MVP Data Analysis Module

This module contains functions for loading, processing, merging, and analyzing NBA MVP data.
It offers capabilities to handle missing data, process player information, and extract insights
related to the highest-scoring players and other statistical trends over the years.

Functions:
    - load_data: Load data from multiple CSV files and return DataFrames along with a dictionary of team nicknames.
    - process_players: Process player data by handling cases with multiple team entries.
    - merge_data: Merge and prepare the combined data for analysis.
    - analyze_data: Analyze and extract insights from the merged data.

Example:
    mvps, players, teams, nicknames = load_data()
    players = process_players(players)
    trains = merge_data(mvps, players, teams)
    highest_scorings, highest_scoring_by_years, player_count_by_years = analyze_data(trains)

Additional analysis or visualization can be performed after running these functions.
